## The shared file system repository ("type": "fs") uses the shared file system to store snapshots. In order to register the shared file system repository 
## it is necessary to mount the same shared filesystem to the same location on all master and data nodes. This location (or one of its parent directories)
## must be registered in the path.repo setting on all master and data nodes.
## path.repo: ["/mount/backups", "/mount/longterm_backups"]
path.repo: ["/usr/share/elasticsearch/backup"]
